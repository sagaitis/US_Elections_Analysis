    "## About this Sprint\n\nIt is time for your first Capstone Project.\nYou will work on this project for the whole Sprint.\n\nWe are glad you have successfully reached the final Sprint of this Module.\nYou will put everything you have learned in this Module to work.\nThe outcome of this Module should potentially serve as your portfolio item.\n\nUnlike with previous projects, this time, you are free to choose a dataset to explore from three suggested ones.\nAs you will have to solve a provided problem, there will not be a list of predefined questions you have to answer - be creative and explore any data dimensions you deem worth analyzing.\n\nAlthough this might seem scary, this is how data science looks like in the industry.\nOften, it's your responsibility to not only give answers using the data but to raise questions first.\nThe more creatively you look at this project, the better.\n\nGood luck!\n\n*Note:* [advice on building your portfolio](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/1002307695/Portfolio+Items)\n\n### Relevant Technical Skills for This Sprint\n\n1. Clean Code Principles (PEP8)\n2. Pandas\n3. Numpy\n4. Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, or others)\n5. Simple Statistical Analysis (basic aggregate analysis)\n6. Proficient use of Jupyter Notebooks\n\n### Skills Not to Be Evaluated\n\n1. Streamlit\n2. Supervised Machine Learning\n3. Dimensionality Reduction\n4. Statistical Significance Tests\n\n## Objectives for this Part\n\n- Practice identifying opportunities for data analysis.\n- Practice performing EDA.\n- Practice working with data from Kaggle.\n- Practice visualizing data with Matplotlib & Seaborn.\n- Practice reading data, performing queries, and filtering data using Pandas.\n\n## Problems\n\nChoose one of the three provided problems.\nThe outcomes are usually better if the problem that you are working on is interesting for you.\nThis way you will come up with more ideas, what can be explored and analysed.\n\n**COVID-19 crisis**\n\n<div><img width=\"400px\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1574515944794-d6dedc7150de?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1532&q=80\" /></div>\n\nThe world is still struggling with one of the most rapidly spreading pandemics.\nThere are a lot of people who say that data is the best weapon we can use in this \"Corona Fight.\"\n\nImagine that you are one of the best data scientists in your country.\nThe president of your country asked you to analyze the COVID-19 patient-level data of South Korea and prepare your homeland for the next wave of the pandemic.\nYou, as the lead data scientist of your country **have to create and prove a plan of fighting the pandemics in your country** by analyzing the provided data.\nYou must get the most critical insights using learned data science techniques and present them to the lead of your country.\n\nThe link to the [Kaggle dataset is here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset/).\n\n**2016 US presidential elections**\n\n<div><img width=\"400px\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583340806569-6da3d5ea9911?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1315&q=80\" /></div>\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump lost the popular vote, yet he won the electoral vote, securing four years in the Oval Office.\nThis has been a shock to Democratic supporters all around the world.\n\nImagine you travel back in time to 2016.\nAs soon as you step out of your time capsule, the Democratic Party hires you.\nThey want you, the best data scientist across time and space, **to explain what happened and what should have been done differently**.\nThey want you to **prepare them for the 2020 presidential elections**.\n\nThe Party has some tips for you - inspect the voters.\nWhat are Trump supporters?\nWhat do they feature?\nWhat are our supporters?\nWhere should focus next?\nAny pro-Trump states?\nCities?\n\nThe Democrats were kind enough to share [a Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benhamner/2016-us-election) with you on the 2016 U.S. elections.\nUse the data to help the Democrats.\n\n**Fatal Police Shooting in the United States**\n\n<div><img width=\"400px\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606352466047-7cef02b312bb?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1662&q=80\" /></div>\n\n[Police brutality in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality_in_the_United_States) has been a national issue since the 20th century.\nThe public safety of U.S. citizens is a typical argument to justify the controversially high number of fatal shootings.\n\nYou are a contractor to the United States Department of Justice.\n**You have been given a case to investigate fatal police shootings throughout the United States of America, provide a list of issues, and propose a plan on how to tackle these issues**.\n\nThe department offered some tips - the public opinion indicates that there's something systematically fishy about the police actions against civilians.\nWe also know that some states differ from the others, some cities are different from others, race equality is still an unanswered question.\nThere's also some talk about huge spendings on police, rumors about mental issues of those getting shot.\nGovernment is all about prioritizing - use the data to list issues with the police activity and propose a plan which issues to tackle first and how.\n\nYou are given one dataset to start with.\nTry to search for more datasets to enrich your data analysis.\n\nHere's the dataset: [Fatal Police Shootings in the U.S. '15 - '17](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/washingtonpost/police-shootings).\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Perform data cleaning and feature engineering. Work with features - handle missing data if needed, use Pandas date APIs, create other additional features.\n- Perform exploratory data analysis. Describe the data with basic statistical parameters - mean, median, quantiles, etc. Use parameters that give you the most important statistical insights of the data. Grouping the data and analyzing the groups - using Pandas aggregate methods. Visualize the data - you can use line, scatter, histogram plots, density plots, regplots, etc.\n- Provide clear explanations in your notebook. Your explanations should inform the reader what you are trying to achieve, what results did you get, and what these results mean.\n- Present the project - the data, methods, and results.\n- Provide suggestions about how your analysis can be improved.\n\n## Bonus Challenges\n\nAs a data scientists you will spend significant amount of your time learning new things.\nSometimes you will do that for fun, but most of the time you will have an urgent problem and you will need to quickly learn some new skill to be able to solve it.\nIt is very important to gradually build this skill - it is extremely valuable for all data scientists.\nThe bonus challenges are designed to simulate these types of situations.\nThese challenges require you to do something that we haven't covered in the course yet.\nInstead of trying to do all of the bonus challenges, concentrate on just one or two and do them well.\nAll of the bonus challenges are optional - no points will be deducted if you skip them.\n\n- Try dimensionality reduction algorithm (e.g. PCA, t-SNE, Autoencoder).\n- Try clustering your data.\n- Try a machine learning model to explain relationships between features and predict new values.\n- Try to use a statistical significance test.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\n- Adherence to the requirements. How well did you meet the requirements?\n- Visualization quality. Did you use charts effectively to visualize patterns in the data? Are your visualizations properly labeled? Did you use colors effectively? Did you adhere to the principle of proportional ink?\n- Code quality. Was your code well-structured? Did you use the appropriate levels of abstraction? Did you remove commented out and unused code? Did you adhere to the PEP8?\n- Code performance. Did you use the suitable algorithms and data structures to solve the problems?\n- Delivery of the presentation. How clear are your reasoning and explanations?\n- Bonus challenges. Have you put extra effort to do one or more of the bonus challenges (no points will be deducted if you skip them)?\n\n## Project Review\n\nDuring your project review, you should present your project as if talking to a product manager and senior data analyst working in your team.\nYou will have to find the right balance between explaining the business side and the technical aspects of your work.\nYou can assume that both of your colleagues have a strong understanding of and are very interested in the business aspect of your project, so be sure to clearly explain what new insights you've found while analyzing the dataset and which directions look the most promising for further research.\nHowever, you should also spend time explaining the technical aspects of your work, especially the more complex or unconventional choices.\n"
